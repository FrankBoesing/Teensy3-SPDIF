# Teensy3-SPDIF
SPDIF-Output for Teensy3.x Audio-Library

Warning: This is ALPHA - testing only!

- Does "Mono"-left channel only (this needs to be rewritten).
- 96 MHz only (this needs to be extended).
- There may be myriads of bugs .
- Needs optimizing.


Simplest hardware is a bright red LED on I2S-TX as "TOSLINK".
Much better are TOSLINK jacks.
